Below are a list of the features included:
- Full GUI implemented.
- Solving using stacks and queues.
- The ability to step through the solution one step at a time.
- The ability to auto-play the solution.
- Console added for feedback.
- JUnit testing added.
- Model, view, controller setup used.
- Runnable JAR included (Java 8 on machine is needed).
- Keyboard shortcuts implemented through menu items at top of GUI.
