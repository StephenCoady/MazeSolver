This is an assignment for a Data Strutures module in my second year. It uses Stacks and Queues to solve a maze. The GUI is written in JavaFX.

Please note Java 8 is needed to run this program.

This assignment is to allow users to display and solve mazes from plain text files. The text files are made up as follows:
- The first line specifies the dimensions of the maze.
- Walls are denoted by "#" symbols, the start by "o", the finish by "*" and all open paths by ".".

Below are a list of the features included:
- Full GUI implemented.
- Solving using stacks and queues.
- The ability to step through the solution one step at a time.
- The ability to auto-play the solution.
- Console added for feedback.
- JUnit testing added.
- Model, view, controller setup used.
- Runnable JAR included (Java 8 on machine is needed).
- Keyboard shortcuts implemented through menu items at top of GUI.
